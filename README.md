# Food Explorer API :hamburger:

This dynamic website serves as a virtual restaurant where users can seamlessly browse, order, and manage their culinary experiences. Customers have the ability to add plates to their cart, mark favorites, and initiate the ordering process. While the payment functionality is in development, key features such as adding plates to orders and managing the cart are operational. In parallel, administrators enjoy exclusive privileges to create and customize plates.

Additionally, a robust search functionality enables users to conveniently explore plates by name or ingredients.
